a simple health log system

## Installation
This program needs [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment.js) to work. Tested with the chart.js built by [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/chart.js?path=dist)

Chart.js and moment.js must be placed on the js folder.
